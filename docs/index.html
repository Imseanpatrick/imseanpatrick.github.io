      <p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts which I created for data analysis, machine learning, teaching, and process automation.</p>

      <h3 id="eopss-project">Automating Data Validations for Public Dashboards</h3>
      <p>This arose from my contract with the State of Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, Data Management team. After determining that an intensive weekly validation process was unnecessarily encumbering the workflow of a team member, I worked with the team member to understand the validation process and made a series of Python functions to automatically transform and analyze the data, turning an 8-hour weekly process into a 5-minute weekly process.

      <h3 id="python-workshops">Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python and Introduction to Python Workshops</h3>
      <p>I created these materials, with assistance and review of some team members, for my Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python workshop. The goal is to take a novice Python programmer through the evaluation and training of traditional machine learning-based text classifiers. Materials are designed to serve as a resource and template.

      <h3 id="twitter-api-program">Twitter API Query Program</h3>
      <p>This program was created with a former colleague to pull data from the now defunct Twitter API for academic researchers. I acquired all tweets used in my research and analysis using this program. The program iterates over the Twitter API call response to format the JSON to a manageable pandas dataframe.

      <h3 id="google-file-copier">Google File Copier</h3>
      <p>Google decided to stop offering free storage for academic accounts. As a result of this, Northeastern IT announced the deletion of student-owned Gmail accounts. The NULab folders contained files owned by student accounts that would be lost in the event of account deletion. I made this program on a time crunch to iterate over folders and files in Google Drive and copy them all to a new directory, safe from deletion.
