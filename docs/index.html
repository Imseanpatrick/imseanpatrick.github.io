      <p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts which I created for data analysis, machine learning, teaching, and process automation.</p>

      <h3 id="sloth-selfie-analysis">Sloth Selfie Analysis</h3>
      <p>This is my own project using NLP in practice in my research. I used the Twitter API to scrape over 20,000 Tweets about sloth selfies to examine captive wildlife tourism on Twitter. I labeled these tweets based on four categories and used these Tweets to train a classifier then pseudolabel the remainder of Tweets for analysis.</p>

      <h3 id="slow-loris-analysis">Slow Loris Analysis</h3>
      <p>I conducted this analysis as part of the early exploration of several captive wildlife tourism datasets I pulled from the Twitter API for academic researchers. The Slow Loris is a small southeastern primate that is commonly considered cute. They are trafficked and their teeth are pulled out so tourists (or performing artists) can take pictures with or pose them. The analysis and resulting presentation focused on the celebrity effect, i.e., the impact celebrities can have on social media chatter about a species of animal.</p>

      <h3 id="google-drive-copy">Google Drive Copy Project</h3>
      <p>Google decided to stop offering free storage for academic accounts. As a result of this, Northeastern IT announced the deletion of student-owned Gmail accounts. The NULab folders contained files owned by student accounts that would be lost in the event of account deletion. I made this program on a time crunch to iterate over folders and files in the Google Drive and copy them all to a new directory safe from deletion.</p>

      <h3 id="eopss-project">EOPSS Project</h3>
      <p>This arose from my contract with the State of Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, Data Management team. After determining that an intensive weekly validation process was unnecessarily encumbering the workflow of a team member, I worked with the team member to understand the validation process and made a series of Python functions to automatically transform and analyze the data, turning an 8-hour weekly process into a 5-minute weekly process.</p>

      <h3 id="mercy-for-animals-twitter-analysis">Mercy for Animals Twitter Account Project</h3>
      <p>This project was my analysis of engagement with the Mercy for Animals Twitter account during my time as a visiting researcher. Much to the delight of the social media coordinator, I discovered that there was a sharp increase in post quality when she took on the posting responsibilities in her new position. There was a decrease in posts but an increase in engagement (likes, retweets), suggesting that the focus on higher quality but less voluminous content was effective.</p>

      <h3 id="mercy-for-animals-faux-meat">Mercy for Animals Faux Meat Project</h3>
      <p>An additional project at Mercy for Animals involved analyzing tweets about Faux meat, namely, Impossible Meat and Beyond Meat. The team wanted to understand the drop-off of interest in and demand for faux meat products following a strong early run. As part of this process, I conducted sentiment analysis on tweets about these products and discovered a decline in positive sentiment in the period following the release of the product.</p>

      <h3 id="python-workshops">Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python and Introduction to Python Workshops</h3>
      <p>I created these materials, with assistance and review of some team members, for my Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python workshop. The goal is to take a novice Python programmer through the evaluation and training of traditional machine learning-based text classifiers. Materials are designed to serve as a resource and template.</p>

      <h3 id="twitter-api-program">Twitter API Program</h3>
      <p>This program was created with a former colleague to pull data from the now defunct Twitter API for academic researchers. I acquired all tweets used in my research and analysis using this program. The program iterates over the Twitter API call response to format the JSON to a manageable pandas dataframe.</p>
